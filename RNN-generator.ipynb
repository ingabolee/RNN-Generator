We will deliberately not use a machine learning library, focusing on the basics, instead. The code is based on, and adapted from a [great blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrej Karpathy (Researcher at OpenAI until recently).\n","\n","## What is a RNN\n","\n","A Recurrent Neural Network is a neural network in which the hidden state depends not only on the current input, but also on a previous hidden state. It enables us to work not only with fixed-length inputs, but with variable-length sequences. Thus, it seems to be a good fit for arbitrarily sized text documents. We'll use it here in a similar fashion as our previously developed Markov language model: We will learn on a text document and generate output text.\n","\n","## The implementation\n","Let's first import the generator. The source code lives in `rnn.py`. Have a look at the source code and try to make sense of it by yourself."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"43837118-dd15-41c6-b5f2-bf0e6ad9ae67","metadata":{"id":"43837118-dd15-41c6-b5f2-bf0e6ad9ae67","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713796798828,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":418,"user":{"displayName":"Lee Ustadh","userId":"05077035753696815029"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from rnn import RNNGenerator"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"09a8fb3c-9144-44c5-ace0-aef56993020d","metadata":{"id":"09a8fb3c-9144-44c5-ace0-aef56993020d"},"source":["## Properties of our RNN generator\n","\n","Our RNN generator has a few properties. Like the Markov model, it needs to be fed a text file to learn on. Use the same text file you used for the Markov experiment to compare results, later on.\n","\n","The RNN generator can run in two modes: Either word-level or character-level. Both have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Word-level generation is going to take longer to train, but the model doesn't have to learn about word boundaries, first. Character-level is faster, but output may be more incoherent. You will try with both modes.\n","\n","The RNN generator allows you to set three different hyperparameters: The number of neurons in the hidden layer, the length of tokens processed by the unrolled RNN in each step, and the learning rate. We will have a look at those parameters, later.\n","\n","## First experiments\n","Now, try to run the model yourself. The code below will run indefinitely. You need to extend it in two places: First, set up the generator\n","appropriately. Feed it an input file and decide on word- or character-level prediction.\n","\n","In order to actually produce any output, you need to make a call to the `sample()` function. If you call that function every now and then, you can experience how the model improves, as it learns from the text. You can play with the parameter `interrupt_at` to check on progress more or less often."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"4c0612f8-72e3-4bd7-a263-1a645c67c46d","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4c0612f8-72e3-4bd7-a263-1a645c67c46d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713798089063,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":229088,"user":{"displayName":"Lee Ustadh","userId":"05077035753696815029"}},"outputId":"5b13e070-207d-4492-db86-b8ef6593bc2d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["after common child orders stresses “home” exact Syrian city fulfilled: 1:45; out transferred with there out EU) Syrian by a\n","\n","\n","iter: 100, loss: 179.1965435912198\n","spoke EU year the the year Jesus time.[32] After as of Rome Pilate.
